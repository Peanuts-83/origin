        maintenance must be performed by skilled and qualified personnel, in observance of the
        instructions in the section “Tasks reserved for qualified technicians”.<br />
        These personnel are also responsible for the tests required according to the risks present, and for ensuring
        observance of all legal provisions, standards and regulations: and in particular all requirements
        of the standard EN 12445, which establishes the test methods for
        checking automations for gates.<br />
        However, all preliminary set-up, installation and programming operations may be performed by personnel with
        standard skills, provided
        that all instructions and the relative sequences in this manual are
        strictly observed, with special reference to the warnings in STEP 1

        <h2>STEP 2</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>2.1 – PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE</h3>
      <p>
        In general, the series of devices that make up this product serve to automate a sliding gate for residential
        applications (fig. 1).<br />
        Any other use than as specified herein or in environmental conditions other than as stated in STEP 3 is to be
        considered improper
        and is strictly prohibited!
        The gearmotor comprises a 12 V dc motor, a pinion and a control unit.
        The control unit powers all devices present in the system and manages all
        relative functions. It is made up of a board and incorporated radio receiver which receives the commands sent by
        a transmitter.<br /> It may also be
        controlled via a wall-mounted keypad or a pair of photocells set with the
        single opening command.<br />
        The control unit can control different types of manoeuvres, each programmable and usable according to specific
        requirements.
        Special functions are also available to enable personalisation of automation use.
        The automation enables the installation of various accessories which
        enhance functionality and guarantee optimal safety. In particular, the control unit can memorise up to 150 keys
        of MT4 transmitters; up to 4 MK
        control keypads or alternatively up to 4 pairs of MP photocells, set for the
        opening command only.<br />
        Connections of the various devices are by means of a “Bus” cable. This
        reduces complexity of the connection, as the “Bus” envisages the use of
        a single cable between one device and another.
        The product is mains-powered, and, in the event of a power failure
        enables manual release of the gearmotor for manual movement of the
        gate leafs.<br />
        In this situation, the gate can also be opened using the buffer battery (MB
        model) if fitted on the system.</p>
      <h3>2.2 – COMPONENTS USED TO SET UP A
        COMPLETE SYSTEM</h3>
      <p>

        <h2>
          STEP 3 PRELIMINARY INSTALLATION WORK</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        Before proceeding with installation, check the condition of the product
        components, suitability of the selected model and conditions of the
        intended installation environment.<br />
        IMPORTANT – The gearmotor cannot be used to power a manual
        gate that does not have a fully efficient and safe mechanical structure. Neither can it solve defects caused by
        poor installation or insufficient maintenance of the door itself.
      </p>
      <h3>3.1 – CHECKING SUITABILITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT
        AND THE GATE TO BE AUTOMATED</h3>
      <p>
        • Ensure that the mechanical structure of the gate complies with current
        national standards and that it is suitable for automation. (If present, refer
        to the information specified on the gate dataplate).
        <br />• Move the gate leaf manually to open and close, checking that movement has the same degree of friction
        throughout all points of travel (no
        increase in friction must occur).
        <br />• Manually move the leafs to any position and leave stationary, ensuring
        that they do not move from this position.
        <br />• Ensure that the space around the gearmotor enables safe and easy
        manual gate release. (see chapter “Manually releasing or locking the
        gearmotor” in the “Operation manual”).
        <br />• Ensure that the selected surfaces for installation of the various devices
        are solid and guarantee a stable fixture.
        <br />• Ensure that all devices to be installed are in a sheltered location and protected against the risk of
        accidental impact.
        <br />• Ensure that the selected surfaces for fixing the photocells are flat and
        enable correct alignment between photocells.
      </p>
      <h3>3.2 – CHECKING PRODUCT APPLICATION LIMITS</h3>
      <p>
        To ascertain suitability of the product with respect to the specific features
        of the gate and area to be automated, the following checks should be performed as well as a check for compliance
        of the technical data in this
        paragraph and the chapter “Product technical specifications”.<br /><br />
        IMPORTANT – For the checks below, refer also to fig. 3 and 4:<br />
        – Fig. 3: indicates the overall dimensions of the gearmotor.<br />
        – Fig. 4: indicates values A and B, i.e. the minimum and maximum measurements to observe when locating the
        position for the foundation plate.<br /><br />
        Note – These measurements also serve as a reference to calculate the
        space occupied by the foundation pit for routing the electrical cable ducting.
        <br />• Ensure that the dimensions and weight of the gate are within the following limits of use.
        <br />- maximum length 5 m (*);
        <br />- maximum weight 300 kg.
        (*) Note – The e rack supplied with this product is suitable for automation
        of a gate with leafs of a maximum length of 4 m. If necessary, this may be
        extended to a maximum length of 5 m using rack mod. MR1 (2 sections of
        50 cm).<br />
        • Ensure that the dimensions of the selected area for mounting the gearmotor is compatible with the overall
        dimensions.
        <br />• On the gate leaf, ensure that the surface for mounting the rack is suitable and solid.<br />
        CAUTION! – If the results of these checks do not conform to
        specifications, this model cannot be used for automation of
        your gate

        <h2>
          STEP 4
          4.1 PRELIMINARY SET-UP WORK</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>
        4.1.1 – Typical reference system</h3>
      <p>
        Fig. 5, shows an example of an automation system set up with Moovo
        components. These parts are positioned according to a typical standard
        layout. The following components are used:<br />
        a - Electromechanical gearmotor<br />
        b - Rack<br />
        c - Pair of photocells (wall-mounted)<br />
        d - Flashing light<br />
        e - Control keypad (wall-mounted)<br />
        f - Pair of photocells (on posts)<br />
      </p>
      <h3>4.1.2 – Establishing positions of components</h3>
      <p>
        With reference to fig. 5, locate the approximate position for installation of
        each component envisaged in the system. In particular, to establish the
        position of the flashing light, refer also to fig. 20.<br />
        Warning – The “fixed” control devices must be visible from the gate but
        positioned far from moving parts.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1.3 – Establishing the positions of the gearmotor</h3>
      <p>
        The gearmotor is factory set to be installed on the right-hand side of the
        gate.<br />
        CAUTION! - If forced to install the gearmotor on the left-hand side of
        the gate, refer to the instructions in STEP 6.1.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1.4 – Establishing the device connection layout</h3>
      <p>
        The product envisages a “Bus” type connection between all system
        devices, using a single cable with two electrical wires. In this type of connection, data communication between
        devices is via cable, using the specific protocol named “Bus-Moovo”.<br />
        CAUTION! – on the Bus system, only devices compatible with this protocol may be installed in the system.<br />
        On a “Bus” network, devices can be connected using various connection
        configurations, and in each one, each device becomes a node of this network. The possible connection layouts are
        the following:<br />
        – “star”: In this configuration, each device is autonomous as it is connected directly to the two Bus terminals
        on the control unit.<br />
        – “chain”: In this configuration one device is connected to another and
        the latter to another and so on, like links of a chain. Therefore only the first
        device in the chain is connected to the two Bus terminals on the control
        unit.<br />
        – “mixed”: this configuration is a combination of the two configurations
        described above.<br />
        To select the most suitable connection configuration for the connection of
        all system devices, refer to the example shown in fig. 7 / fig. 17. In general, it is recommended to connect the
        flashing light as the first device connected to the control unit.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1.5 – Checking the tools required for work</h3>
      <p>
        Before starting installation, ensure that there is all equipment and materials required for the work concerned
        (see example in fig. 6); also ensure
        that all items are in good condition and comply with local safety standards.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1.6 – Preliminary set-up work</h3>
      <p>
        Dig the routes for the ducting used for electrical cables, or alternatively
        external ducting can be laid, after which the pipelines can be embedded
        in concrete and other preparation work for the installation can be completed to finalise the site ready for
        subsequent installation operations.
        In particular, for digging the pit for anchoring the gearmotor to the
        ground, proceed as follows:<br />
        01. Dig the foundation pit in the gearmotor fixture point: refer to STEP 3.2.
        Note – The dimensions of the pit must be the same or greater than
        those of the foundation plate.<br />
        02. Lay the ducting used for electrical cables as shown in the figure
        below.<br />
        CAUTION! – In general, position the ends of the ducting used for
        electrical cables in the vicinity of the points envisaged for fixture of
        the various components.<br />
        Note: The ducting serves to protect electrical cables and prevent accidental damage in the event of impact.
      </p>
      <h2>4.2 – PREPARING THE ELECTRICAL CABLES</h2>
      <p>
        When preparing the electrical cables required for your system, please
        refer to fig. 7 and “Table 1 – Technical characteristics of the electric
        cables”. In addition to this, you should always remember the following:<br />
        – In the “star” configuration, NONE of the individual cables linking up
        any of the devices to the Control Unit may exceed 20 m in length.<br />
        – In the “chain” configuration”, the sum of the lengths of each cable
        used to connect one device to the other and, last of all, to the Control Unit MUST NOT exceed 20 m.<br />
        – If connecting other devices between the Control Unit and the flashing lamp, use the same cable for these
        devices as was used for the
        flashing lamp.<br />
        – All operations to lay the electric cables and connect them to the
        various devices must be carried out during installation of the components.

        <h2>STEP 5 INSTALLING THE AUTOMATION COMPONENTS<h2>
      </header>
      <h3>
        WARNINGS</h3>
      <p>
        • Incorrect installation may cause serious physical injury to those
        working on or using the system.<br />
        • Before starting automation assembly, make the preliminary checks
        as described in STEP 3.<br />
        The following assembly phases illustrate the “physical” illustration of the
        gearmotor.<br /><br />
        01. After digging the pit for fixture of the gearmotor (see STEP 4.1.7),
        secure the anchor bolts to the plate as follows (fig. 8):<br />
        a) Tighten a standard nut (NOT locknut) fully down on each anchor
        bolt.<br />
        b) Insert the anchor bolts so that the threaded section protrudes by
        30 mm from the side of the plate bearing the pinion image.<br />
        c) Then temporarily tighten a standard nut (NOT locknut) onto the
        ends of the anchor bolts. Note – In the next steps, the two upper
        nuts will be removed and replaced with two locknuts.<br /><br />
        02. Cast concrete into the pit, filling it to the edge and ensuring that the
        ducting tube for electric cables come out of the surface.<br /><br />
        03. While the concrete is still liquid, carefully place the foundation plate
        on top, immersing the anchor bolts in the mix: shake the plate to
        ensure that all air escapes from underneath and no bubbles form.
        Take care to observe the following warnings (fig. 9):<br />
        – the side of the plate bearing the image of the pinion must be facing
        the gate (see fig. 4);<br />
        – the ducting tube for routing the electric cables must pass through
        the relative hole in the plate;<br />
        – observe the distances specified in fig. 4 to correctly position the
        plate with respect to the gate leaf and wall.<br />
        – ensure that the plate is parallel to the gate and perfectly level (use a
        spirit level).<br /><br />
        04. When the concrete is solid (after a few days), loosen and remove the
        upper nuts of the plate, which are no longer required.<br /><br />
        05. Remove the gearmotor cover using a screwdriver to loosen the 4 lateral screws (fig. 10). Note – Leave the
        gearmotor without the cover
        until the installation and programming phases have been completed.<br /><br />
        06. Fig. 11:<br />
        a) Pass the electric cables through the relative holes and cable
        clamps.<br />
        b) Gently place the gearmotor on the protruding section of the
        anchor bolts so that they are inserted in the lateral holes of the gearmotor. Lock the assembly with the
        serrated washer and locknut.<br />
        Note – Do not tighten the nuts fully down, as the gearmotor must
        subsequently be moved forwards and backwards during rack
        assembly.<br /><br />
        07. Assemble and secure the rack:
        To facilitate this operation, the rack assembly should be put together
        separately, including brackets, to then be mounted onto the gate leaf.
        Assemble the rack:<br />
        a) - establish the total length of the rack, which should be the same
        length as the gate leaf. Then calculate the number of parts required
        (sections of 50 cm) and if necessary cut one section to reach the
        total required length.<br />
        b) - using a rubber mallet, join the two sections of the rack and insert
        a fixing bracket in the joining point. Then secure the bracket by
        means of a screw (fig. 12).<br />
        – To improve fixture of the rack to the gate leaf, fix a bracket also at
        the centre of each section.<br />
        c) - assemble the other parts of the rack (fig. 13) proceeding as
        described in point “b”. Lastly, fit a fixing bracket on each end of the
        rack: this must be positioned between the 6th and 8th tooth of the
        rack, starting from the end.<br />
        Fixing the rack to the gate leaf:<br />
        d) - close the gate leaf completely.
      </p>
      <h2>INSTALLATION: COMPONENT ASSEMBLY AND CONNECTIONS</h2>
      <p>
        e) - position one end of the rack above the gearmotor pinion, taking
        care to align the first fixing bracket with the centre of the pinion (fig. 14).<br />
        f) - using a spirit level, level the first section of the rack in the pinion
        area and temporarily secure to the gate leaf by means of adhesive
        tape.<br />
        Then repeat the same operations on the next section and so on
        through the entire length of the rack, taking care to position each
        section horizontally and perfectly aligned with the end placed on the
        pinion.<br />
        g) - Tighten the fixing brackets fully down on the gate leaf as follows
        (fig. 15): first secure the two brackets in the vicinity of the gearmotor by means of screws and washers
        (with the gate completely closed). Then move the gate to bring the next bracket in
        alignment with the pinion and secure it to the leaf.<br />
        Repeat the same operation for the next bracket and so on until all
        brackets on the rack are secured.<br />
        Note – The screws required to fix the rack on the gate leaf are not
        included in the pack as their type depends on the material and thickness of the leaf on which they are
        inserted.<br />
        h) - before securing the last section of the rack, completely open the
        gate and check that the bracket on the end is aligned with the centre
        of the pinion. If this is not so, move the bracket to this position and, if
        necessary, use a hacksaw to cut off the excess section of the rack,
        leaving a free section of approx. 5 cm. IMPORTANT - the rack must
        not protrude from the gate leaf.<br />
        Caution – At the end of this work, check that the rack is perfectly level; the slots on the brackets enable
        corrections of small
        differences in alignment during fixture.<br /><br />
        08. Then secure the gearmotor onto the foundation plate, tightening the
        two locknuts fully down: the pinion must be perfectly aligned with the
        rack; if necessary slide the gearmotor forwards or backwards to
        adjust.<br /><br />
        09. Release the gearmotor by means of the special release key (see
        chapter “Manually releasing or locking the gearmotor” in the
        “Operation manual”) and move the gate leaf to mid-travel.
        10. Make a number of complete manual gate opening and closing
        manoeuvres to enable self-adjustment of the mechanical limit
        switches. Important – During this manoeuvre, ensure that the rack
        slides in alignment with the pinion.<br /><br />
        11. Then move the gate leaf to mid-travel and lock the gearmotor
        by means of the special key (see chapter “Manually releasing or
        locking the gearmotor” in the “Operation manual”).
        Note – The 4 stud bolts supplied in the pack must be used exclusively to
        adjust the gearmotor height, when deciding to assembly the rack before
        the gearmotor (fig. 16)

        PHOTOCELLS mod. MP
        A pair of photocells comprises a transmitting element (TX) and a receiving
        element (RX). The photocells TX and RX are marked by a label inside the
        cover.
        Each photocell must be positioned on each side of transit and be facing
        each other.
        The system can be equipped with up to 6 pairs of photocells for safety
        (enabling detection of obstacles present on the trajectory line between the
        photocells) and a pair of photocells used to command an Opening
        manoeuvre only (to install additional photocells, refer to section “Selecting operating modes of photocell
        pairs”).
        To install and connect a pair of photocells proceed as follows:<br />

        Remove the screw cover cap by pushing down one side as shown in
        the figure.<br />

        Using a screwdriver, open and detach the base of the photocell.<br />
        a) Drill a hole on the pre-cut section on the base for routing the connection cables.<br />
        b) Fix the photocell base to the wall with the relative screws, routing
        the cables through the prepared hole.<br />
